## 🍋 Pluginade - When life gives you plugins, use Pluginade. 👋
Pluginade exists to help make WordPress plugin development easier, and is a free, open source project by Phil Johnston and friends.

> I started Pluginade because, after building hundreds of WordPress plugins and maintaining their build/test/lint scripts all separately, I couldn't bear the thought of starting yet-another-plugin. But then I starting thinking, "what if all my plugins could share a single configuration for those things". After all, they all use the same PHPUnit, the same WPCS config/rules, the same process for building/bundling/zipping. That idea was the beginning of Pluginade, and it energized me to be able to start building new WP plugins again. - Phil
